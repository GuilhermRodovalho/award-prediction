                        quote: "Entering the twilight of her underwhelming life, an exhausted laundromat owner finds an outlet. I'm not sure how much more of the plot I can give away, because the shock absurdity of it all is a big part of what makes Everything Everywhere All at Once tick. Suffice to say, it's every bit as oddly, magically confounding as the directors' previous film, Swiss Army Man, which featured a fart-propelled corpse skimming waves and dispensing profound life lessons.\n\nDaniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan, collectively known as \"The Daniels,\" have carved themselves a distinct niche with these two films, alike in their polished visual excellence and strangely potent sense of sentimentality. After the sheer, gargantuan silliness of these concepts has essentially disarmed you, they posit, you're ripe for a deeper, more resonant message or two. In this case, the despondent store owner (Michelle Yeoh, who's fabulous) addresses the strain of parent-child relations from both sides and comes to terms with her own abundant, unrealistic aspirations and expectations. It's deep, powerful, universal stuff, which just so happens to be spread across a series of increasingly wacky, music-video kung-fu action scenes and random, contorted pop culture references.\n\nPut simply, this movie is a trip. The first act is demanding, a dizzying rush of big exposition and long elaboration that whirls between English and several subtitled Chinese dialects, but that lengthy setup is essential to unlock the delightful insanity of the next hour. Once the real ride is underway, it's an uncontrollable snowball of fanny packs and razor blades. Riotously entertaining; you've gotta see this.",

                        quote: "Watching this movie is nothing short of a torturous experience, as its intentions are blatantly obvious from the start.\nThe movie begins in a material world filled with vulgarization and suddenly shifts into parallel universes, seemingly entering the realm of science fiction. However, unlike what pro-movie critics claim, this film is not a work of science fiction. \nIn science fiction, time is defined and structured. Here, we start in a realistic modern world and are abruptly thrown into parallel universes, making the movie an undisciplined fantasy rather than true science fiction. \nWe do not see the protagonist‚Äôs postmodern boredom, a Chinese immigrant woman who runs a small laundering business and faces issues with the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, due to unpaid taxes.\nIs this enough to justify escaping into postmodern parallel universes filled with Kung Fu, bizarre action, and other elements that are only tolerable for the first five minutes? The directors seem to believe that love can be indicated in a world where the universe is against you. However, the universe is not against love; it is the world of being, where humans and their environments coexist.\nThe protagonist is not portrayed as a subject in the way Marvel heroes are. Instead, she is an object within these caricatured worlds. In one universe, she is a chef, borrowing from the movie \"Ratatouille\" but turning the idea vulgar. Another world is an absolute travesty where every finger is a hotdog. The movie attempts to show love in this absurd hotdog universe, but it falls flat. The protagonist‚Äôs crisis is deep-rooted, yet the film fails to explore it meaningfully. \nThe movie is filled with themes of routine life, love, family, humanity, compassion, and kindness, but it presumes that cinema is a place for such things without building its characters properly. \nThe nomination for ten awards is baffling, as the movie is merely a collage of ideas without depth. \nThe movie embodies postmodern nihilism, where everything is lessened and vulgarized. This nihilism belongs to the consumerist culture of capitalism, where humans become objects of consumption.\nUnlike modern nihilism, which still retains certain footprints of God, postmodern nihilism lacks any such elements. The film‚Äôs absurdity is not a rebellion against the postmodern world but a depression before modernism. It attempts to interpret numerous concepts but fails to do so effectively, as it is oversaturated with technique and lacks genuine substance.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Everything, Everywhere, All at Once\" is a confusing, nonsensical, and tedious movie.",

Evelyn, who is about to go bankrupt and owed taxes, as a mother, wife and daughter, turns a deaf ear to her children's requests, turns a deaf ear to her husband's divorce appeal, and even perverts her father's ****. She lives on like this, and her daughter's rebellion makes her upset. A series of events occurred in the background of this family's lack of communication, the demon daughter with her world view - devours all negative energy, the world may be better without human beings, even if it is a stone quietly, the universe is large, most of the planets are like this, there is no sin. Evelyn also saw what would have happened if she had not followed her husband. All this only makes her more tired, she can let her daughter fly away, meet her husband's divorce demands, accept that her father does not recognize her as a daughter, but she still chooses to have them, because love transcends time and space, no matter which parallel universe you are in, this will not change. A film encapsulates the world view, life view, love view and family view, conditioning clear, comedy effect is excellent, imagination is large, it is not an exaggeration to say that this is a peak work.",

It's flawed, goofy and illogical at times, but it works, it's fresh, unique, and I was a bit skeptical at the beginning, but then I got hooked as the movie started to develop.\nI felt connected to the main character (Evelyn) struggles because at it's core, the movie is not supposed to be a hero's story, but a personal, intimate and complex story about everyday life, it's about family, choices, sacrifice, resentment and how the same situation can be perceived as something awful someone might want to escape while others might dream about it.\nThe whole multiverse idea, the fighting, the verse jumps can be inconsistent and even ridiculous but as soon as you accept it, it becomes entertaining and everything starts to connect as you start seeing the metaphors and the character's progression.\nThe acting of Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan are both phenomenal and well deserving of the Oscars they won, they really immerse themselves in the characters and personify to perfection the essence of the movie.\nThe camera work is creative and I caught myself complementing it a few times while watching, some might say it breaks the immersion, but I find it interesting and entertaining.\nColors look good and they match the tone of each scene.\nOverall, it's a great movie and I'm glad they won the Best Picture Oscar because it actually made me feel everything everywhere all at once.",

                        quote: "The film, which won seven Academy Awards, was directed by Daniels. He co-directed only two films, Swiss Army Man and this one. Nevertheless, he beat Spielberg at the Oscars.\n\nThe film was produced by A24, a company with tremendous momentum, which also produced The Whale and Aftersun in the same year. He released this film at a time when he had a lot of momentum, but it was not expected at first.\n\nAlthough Michelle Yeoh, Jamie Lee Curtis, and other somewhat familiar actors were in the film, supporting actor Kee Hui Quan had not had a prominent role since The Goonies, and the rest were new actors. However, the performances by the cast were excellent, and in total, the film received four Oscar nominations, three of which were won.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, Michelle Yeoh runs a dry-cleaning business and is a realistic protagonist with a gay daughter, a difficult dry-cleaning business, a noisy father, and an unreliable husband. Later, her husband arrives from another world claiming a crisis in the multiverse, and she is quickly pulled away from reality, but in the end, she settles for a realistic ending. It is easy to explain why this film is so beloved. It offers unrealistic, exciting fun and settles on a simple theme of family love. The characters are all flawed but lovable, and after watching the film, you love the film itself. The film is also rated R, which means it is suitable for adults. It is a good opportunity for adults to rethink the idea of family love.\n\nThere are glimpses of Daniels' humor in the film. He does ''funny things'' when he moves to another multiverse. Eating lip balm, saying I really love you... these are all apparently Daniels' ideas. It was a bizarre and funny film that was nominated for 11 Oscars and won 7, but I don't know if it was the right one. I don't know if I got it right, because my favorite film, The Fablemans, was nominated for 7 categories but didn't win any of them.",

I've seen iconic movies from Citizen Kane, Vertigo, The Godfather, Goodfellas, Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, Schindler's List, The Shawshank Redemption, Back to the Future, and the list goes on. Looking back at this movie in ten years, I feel it will be given its place among those greats and be regarded as such. It's a cinematic marvel and one of the greatest movies ever made.",

It possesses enough subtlety for people to interpret the movie's themes in whatever way they wish.\n\nWhile this movie has received a great deal of positive attention after its release, it pleases me greatly to say that the praise feels earned.

The humour was excellent, with a wide range of modern humour, old people humour and even dirty humour, though whenever a joke was made which I wasn't interested in, it was something so 'on the side' as an extra that it gave no detriment to the scene. The cinematography was the best of its kind, including sudden dramatic shot changes with beautiful transitions. I have never seen better camera work or cinematography in my entire life. The acting was incredible, with the perfect cast of emotional characters which you could really feel for. At no point was it at obvious it was a production. Even the subtitles were warping with the camera effects! The set design was soo good and really did a good job at holding the scenes. The fighting sequences were unmatched with perfect timing and consistency. I love action sequences of that sort in movies, and these were the most incredible fight sequences I have ever seen. Absolutely astounding. The greatest work in any film I have ever seen, and is my new personal favourite movie of all time.",

As a comedy it fails, its humor is very childish and ridiculous, there are comedy movies from the time of our grandparents whose humor still seems funny to us today, the humor of this movie is almost purely visual by showing ridiculous fights or characters dressed in ridiculous to say an example. As a science fiction genre, it also fails, despite the fact that the genre is fantasy, in general, the universe that we are presented with has consistency, it is credible, it has logic and if there are elements that are not very credible, they end up being few or scarce. The science fiction of this movie is so silly, so unbelievable that I can't really immerse myself in it. The story and relationship between the mother and her daughter, and how it develops, doesn't seem bad to me, but the other elements that I mentioned before are like ruining the experience of the movie itself. The film is new, I don't know if you could even talk about a new genre because of how incredibly chaotic it is, but even so, the stupidity of the plot, the stupidity of its universe, the bad humor, the nonsense of how several of the events take place that make me unable to recommend it and rate it negatively.",
